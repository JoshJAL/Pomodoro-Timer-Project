# Pomodoro-Timer-Project
This is a Pomodoro Timer for productivity with a progress bar and adjustable focus and break durations.

If you struggle with staying focused or knowing when to stop your break this is a great tool to use. I have it set up so by default it will time out a 25 minute focus session and then a 5 minute break. This is a great way to get a lot accomplished and not get burnt out.
